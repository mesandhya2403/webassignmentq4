    <p class="big"><strong>(Adding "big" class on a paragraph increases the font size to 20 and also changes the background-color)</strong><br>Having a good habit is like having a very important life skill. Just like clay, a child's habit can be molded easily when he/she is young.

        With each passing day, they get exposed to various physical and mental tasks. It is easy for them to pick up habits (be it good or bad).
        
        As adults, it becomes extremely difficult to change a habit. Every child is the future of their parents. Therefore, to make the future bright, parents always strive to ensure that their child learns and adopts only good habits and practices. 

        Good habits refer to the behavior that is beneficial for the development of the physical or mental health of a person.
        
        It is often linked to a high level of discipline and self-control. These habits help a person in various aspects of their life.
        
        At the same time, they also help them to continually develop or improve their surrounding conditions.</p>

        Keep it positive
        “Helping your children develop a positive attitude can greatly contribute to their well-being throughout their lives and help them build resilience,” says Dr. Leek. “Tell kids what they can do, not what they can’t and celebrate successes.”
        
         Limit screen time
        Children and teens are growing up immersed in the digital world, exposed to digital media at all hours of the day, including computers, smartphones and television. Parents play an important role in teaching their children how to use screen time in a healthy way that can enhance daily life.
